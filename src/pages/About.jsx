        chapter in the book. The player goal is to gather the scattered chapters and to draw a map
        of Zoomland that identifies the 4 regions (History, Media, Hermeneutics and Digital
        landscapes) and assign a symbol to each chapter according to the 3 perspectives (bird's eye,
        overhead and ground view)."
