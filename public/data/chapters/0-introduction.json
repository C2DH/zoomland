  "abstract": "This chapter outlines the conceptual framework of the book and the va-riety of viewpoints related to the use of the notion of scale and zooming in digitalhistory and humanities. The contributions included in the volume encompass dif-ferent degrees of theoretical assumptions, practical insights and middle-groundreflections, symbolically expressed through the three conceptual levels:birdâ€™s-eyeview,overhead viewandground view. While no general theory of scale is defined,the reader is offered the ingredients needed to build such theoretical constructsbased on his or her own exploratory and symbolic journey through Zoomland.This variable-scale representation is combined with four categories of enquiry orthematic realms that make up the territory of Zoomland:History,Media,Herme-neuticsandDigital landscapes",
